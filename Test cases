-- Negative test cases--

- Try to launch app without internet connection

For all negative cases, the expected result must be appropriate messages


How would you define a problematic release and which aspects would you focus on to avoid it?

- In my experience after fix existing bugs, the problematic release of app need to be covered with regression test to make sure the required functionality off app is covered.
